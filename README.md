### 1)Digital System Design using Verilog 
here me and my teamates worked on verilog project which is Design and implement to find the square root of number 
using Newton Raphson Method. in this repo you will find the ppt of our work and image of obtained results.

### 2)Digital Circuits 
here me and my teamates worked on DC course project. the problem statement is DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A DIGITAL SYSTEM TO FILL THE N NUMBER OF COLD DRINK BOTTLES  CONTINUOSLY SUCH THAT IN ONE HOUR MACHINE CAN FILL 60 LITRES OF COLD DRINK.in this repo you will find the ppt of our work with the simulation results with proteus file.
