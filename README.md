## This section contains all my academic and external projects
### Project 1 | Active Filter Design Second Order Low pass and High Pass 
    • Firstly, we have discovered the universal active filter / state variable filter 
      in the textbooks and some research papers. We have thoroughly read the 
      construction and working of that universal filter. 
    • Next, we have simulated and verified the working of the universal filter 
      using Ideal Operational amplifiers in the cadence virtuoso tool. 
    • Then We have designed the Two stage differential amplifier with certain 
      specifications and verified the working of that amplifier in cadence tool, 
      that is its giving correct gain and bandwidth that is required. 
    • Finally, we have replaced the Ideal operational amplifier with two stage 
      differential amplifier and simulated the working of that overall circuit, as a 
      result we got the all-filter responses (low, high and band pass).  
### Project 2 | Denoising of ECG signal to Predict Heart rate 
    • Firstly, we have collected the ECG dataset from the physio net organization 
      and done the frequency analysis of ECG signal using Fast Fourier Transform 
      (FFT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). 
    • From the frequency analysis we come to know that the frequency range of that 
      ECG signal and how the noise is distributed in the signal, also checked the 
      frequency range of QRS components because the heart rate is determined 
      based on that component only. 
    • Next, we have removed the noise and extracted the QRS components from our 
      ECG signal using Impulse Invariance Response (IIR) filtering method and 
      Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering methods. Selected the best among all 
      filtering methods and predicted the heart rate with the help of R peaks of ECG 
      signal.
### Project 3 | Agri Predict: Crop Selection through Neural Networks For Sustainable Agricultural Growth 
    • Agri predict is a novel framework aimed at promoting sustainable agricultural 
      growth through informed crop selection. Due to educational constraints and 
      limited access to precise information, farmers in India often make suboptimal 
      crop choices, overlooking essential factors like soil, climate, and 
      environmental conditions.  
    • This leads to reduced yields and financial losses. To address this issue, we 
      propose the use of machine learning algorithms, specifically Neural Networks, 
      to predict optimal crop selections based on environmental and soil 
      parameters. The model considers critical factors such as Nitrogen, 
      Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Crop Type, Humidity, Rainfall, and ph.  
    • The results demonstrate an impressive accuracy of over 98%, highlighting the 
      effectiveness of Agri predict in assisting farmers in making informed decisions 
      about crop selection. 
### Project 4 | Ultrasonic Motor control: Bridging Distance with Precision  
    • We have designed a system that is robotic arm whenever it detects the 
      obstacles in the front while travelling in the path then it takes the turn 
      clockwise/anticlockwise direction. 
    • We have implemented this system using the ARM Microcontroller (lpc2148 
      board), we are checking the distance of obstacle from the robotic arm with the 
      help of ultrasonic sensor. 
    • We have implemented this system in Cortex M3 development board also, we 
      have used the Tasks and Event registers in the code.
